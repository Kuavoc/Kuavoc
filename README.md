Hi, I'm pretty new to everything and I don't know how to do most things that people do here, 
I have GitHub because I'm interesed in learning them.

I don't write very good in english but I do know how to read it properly, 
I **love** old horror RPGMaker games (Like Mad father, Oneshot, OFF, etc) 
I'm currently interested in: Minecraft Modding, if you have guides/tutorials/resources 
or anything that you think would be helpful to me to learn, i would be grateful if you showed me them! 
(Especially if they are about Fabric)
